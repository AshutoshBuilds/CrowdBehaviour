# Q&A
- Q: Which additional model architectures do you want to compare besides the current ResNet? (e.g., EfficientNet, Vision Transformer, DenseNet, MobileNet, custom CNN)  
  A: EfficientNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), DenseNet, MobileNet, custom CNN.
- Q: Which dataset/splits should we use for comparison?  
  A: Same dataset with augmentations.
- Q: Which metrics matter most for comparison?  
  A: F1, accuracy, loss.
- Q: Any compute constraints?  
  A: Single GPU only; need short training runs (~<1h each) and CPU acceptable.
